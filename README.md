# Final-Project
Here is my final project created for CIS 1068

## Difficulties
A problem that I ran into early in the creation stages was allowing a full song to play which turned out to be not part of the Napster API so it changed
the direction I wanted to take the application into. Another problem I ran into is choosing the correct song which turned out to be a luck of the draw type ordeal where you basically
had to search for a song and be as descriptive as possible using artist and song name and hope the API returns the correct selection.'

## Future Updates
I would like it to be moreso like an IPod application where you can search for a song and add it to your playlist so that it can be played back without you searching for it again.
